# RTSP Stream Fix - Applied

## ✅ Fix Applied Successfully

### What Was Changed

**File:** `packages/local_cpp/config.json`

**Before:**
```json
"url": "rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264"
```

**After:**
```json
"url": "rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264Preview_01_main"
```

### Why This Fix Works

Your Reolink camera (192.168.4.252) supports multiple RTSP stream profiles:
- `h264Preview_01_main` - Main stream (high quality, higher bandwidth)
- `h264Preview_01_sub` - Sub stream (lower quality, lower bandwidth)

The generic `/h264` path doesn't work with this camera model. The correct path is `/h264Preview_01_main`.

### Verification

Your camera is confirmed working:
- ✅ Camera is online and accessible (192.168.4.252)
- ✅ Web interface is accessible (login works)
- ✅ Live video feed is streaming
- ✅ Credentials are correct (admin/test1234)
- ✅ Network connectivity is good

The only issue was the incorrect RTSP URL path.

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Rebuild the C++ Client

**Option A: Using the batch script (easiest)**
```bash
cd packages/local_cpp
rebuild.bat
```

**Option B: Manual rebuild**
```bash
cd packages/local_cpp/build_full
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Step 2: Run the Client

```bash
cd packages/local_cpp/build_full/Release
local_cpp_client.exe
```

### Step 3: Check Console Output

**Look for these success indicators:**
```
OpenCV version: 4.x.x
[StreamReader] Validating URL: rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264Preview_01_main
[StreamReader] Attempting backend: FFMPEG (ID: 0)
[StreamReader] Successfully opened stream with backend: FFMPEG
[StreamReader] Stream properties - FPS: 30, Resolution: 1920x1080
[StreamReader] Connected to stream: rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264Preview_01_main
Stats - FPS: 15.00, Processed: 15, Dropped: 0, Inferences: 0/0, Avg Latency: 0.0ms
```

### Step 4: Verify Stream is Working

**Check 1: Console shows FPS > 0**
```
Stats - FPS: 15.00, Processed: 15, ...
```

**Check 2: Health endpoint**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8085/status
```
Should show: `"stream_connected": true`

**Check 3: Log file**
```bash
tail -f logs/cpp_client.log
```
Should show frames being processed with increasing frame count.

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Not Working

**Check 1: Verify config.json was updated**
```bash
cat packages/local_cpp/config.json | grep "url"
```
Should show: `"url": "rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264Preview_01_main"`

**Check 2: Try alternative Reolink stream**
If main stream doesn't work, try sub stream:
```json
"url": "rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264Preview_01_sub"
```

**Check 3: Verify network connectivity**
```bash
ping 192.168.4.252
```
Should respond with replies.

**Check 4: Test with VLC**
```bash
vlc "rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264Preview_01_main"
```
Should play video.
