# RTSP Stream Capture Fix - Complete Index

## Overview
This document indexes all changes made to fix RTSP stream capture failures in the C++ edge client.

## Problem Statement
The C++ edge client (packages/local_cpp) was failing to capture frames from RTSP streams, resulting in 0 FPS and no processed frames. Root causes included incorrect RTSP URLs, missing OpenCV FFMPEG support, and silent failures in VideoCapture.

## Solution Summary
Enhanced stream_reader.cpp with comprehensive diagnostics, timeout protection, URL validation, and detailed error messages. Added multiple documentation guides for troubleshooting.

## Files Modified

### 1. packages/local_cpp/src/stream_reader.cpp
**Status:** ✅ Updated with enhanced diagnostics

**Changes:**
- Added OpenCV build information logging on startup
- Implemented URL format validation
- Added 5-second timeout protection for VideoCapture.open()
- Enhanced backend attempt logging with detailed status
- Added stream properties reporting (FPS, resolution)
- Implemented comprehensive error messages with diagnostics
- Added actionable suggestions for troubleshooting

**Key Improvements:**
- Prevents hanging on network issues
- Provides clear visibility into connection attempts
- Suggests specific troubleshooting steps
- Reports OpenCV capabilities

**Example Output (Success):**
```
OpenCV version: 4.5.5
[StreamReader] Validating URL: rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264Preview_01_main
[StreamReader] Attempting backend: FFMPEG (ID: 0)
[StreamReader] Successfully opened stream with backend: FFMPEG
[StreamReader] Stream properties - FPS: 30, Resolution: 1920x1080
[StreamReader] Connected to stream: rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264Preview_01_main
```

**Example Output (Failure with Diagnostics):**
```
[StreamReader] Validating URL: rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264
[StreamReader] Attempting backend: FFMPEG (ID: 0)
[StreamReader] Failed to open with backend: FFMPEG
[StreamReader] Attempting backend: GStreamer (ID: 1)
[StreamReader] Backend GStreamer timed out (>5s)
Failed to open stream with any backend. Diagnostics:
  URL: rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264
  Possible causes:
    1. RTSP URL is incorrect (check camera brand-specific paths)
    2. OpenCV not built with FFMPEG support
    3. Network unreachable (firewall, IP, port 554)
    4. Camera credentials invalid (admin:test1234)
    5. Camera offline or stream not available
  Suggestions:
    - Use /discover endpoint to find correct RTSP URL
    - Test with VLC: vlc 'rtsp://admin:test1234@192.168.4.252:554/h264'
    - Check network connectivity: ping 192.168.4.252
    - Verify OpenCV build includes FFMPEG support
```

## Troubleshooting Decision Tree

```
START: RTSP stream not working (0 FPS)
│
├─ Rebuild C++ client
│  └─ Run and check console output
│
├─ See "Successfully opened stream"?
│  ├─ YES → ✅ DONE! Frames are being captured
│  │        Check logs for FPS > 0
│  │
│  └─ NO → Continue to next step
│
├─ See "Failed to open stream with any backend"?
│  ├─ YES → Most likely: Wrong RTSP URL
│  │        → Go to QUICK_START_RTSP.md Step 3
│  │
│  └─ NO → Check console for specific error
│
├─ Test RTSP URL with VLC
│  ├─ VLC plays video → URL is correct
│  │                    Issue: OpenCV build or network
│  │                    → Go to RTSP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md Step 4-5
│  │
│  └─ VLC fails → URL is wrong
│                 → Use /discover endpoint
│                 → Try alternative paths
│                 → Go to STREAM_READER_DIAGNOSTICS.md (RTSP URL Formats)
│
├─ Check network connectivity
│  ├─ ping 192.168.4.252 fails → Network unreachable
│  │                             → Check firewall, IP, credentials
│  │
│  └─ ping succeeds → Network OK
│                     → Check OpenCV build
│
├─ Check OpenCV build
│  ├─ FFMPEG: YES → Build is OK
│  │               → Issue is likely RTSP URL
│  │
│  └─ FFMPEG: NO → Rebuild OpenCV with FFMPEG
│                  → Go to RTSP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md Option B
│
└─ ✅ FIXED!
```

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Issue | Most Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 0 FPS, no frames | Wrong RTSP URL | Use /discover endpoint, test with VLC |
| "Failed to open stream" | OpenCV lacks FFMPEG | Rebuild OpenCV with `-DWITH_FFMPEG=ON` |
| "Backend timed out" | Network issue or wrong URL | Verify network, try different RTSP path |
| "Stream connected but 0 FPS" | Frame read failing | Check resolution, disable hardware decode |
| High latency/dropped frames | Queue full | Increase queue sizes, reduce fps_cap |

## Implementation Details

### URL Validation
```cpp
// Validates URL scheme before attempting connection
if (config_.url.find("rtsp://") != 0 && 
    config_.url.find("http://") != 0 && 
    config_.url.find("https://") != 0 && 
    config_.url.find("file://") != 0) {
    handle_error("Invalid URL scheme...");
    return false;
}
```

### Timeout Protection
```cpp
// Prevents VideoCapture.open() from hanging indefinitely
std::thread open_thread([this, backend, &open_success, &open_done]() {
    open_success = cap_.open(config_.url, backend);
    open_done = true;
});

// Wait up to 5 seconds
auto start = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
while (!open_done.load() && 
       std::chrono::steady_clock::now() - start < std::chrono::seconds(5)) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
}
```

### Enhanced Logging
```cpp
// Reports stream properties on successful connection
double fps = cap_.get(cv::CAP_PROP_FPS);
int width = static_cast<int>(cap_.get(cv::CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH));
int height = static_cast<int>(cap_.get(cv::CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT));

std::cout << "[StreamReader] Stream properties - FPS: " << fps 
         << ", Resolution: " << width << "x" << height << std::endl;
```

---

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Rebuild
```bash
cd packages/local_cpp/build_full
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Step 2: Run
```bash
./Release/local_cpp_client.exe 2>&1 | tee debug.log
```

### Step 3: Verify
- Check console for "Successfully opened stream"
- Check logs for FPS > 0
- Check health endpoint: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8085/status`

## FAQ

**Q: Why is my RTSP URL wrong?**
A: Different camera brands use different paths. Use /discover endpoint or test with VLC to find the correct one.

**Q: How do I know if OpenCV has FFMPEG?**
A: Run `cmake .. -DWITH_FFMPEG=ON` in build directory. Look for `-- FFMPEG: YES` in output.

**Q: What if the timeout is too short?**
A: Modify the 5-second timeout in stream_reader.cpp connect() method if needed.

**Q: Can I use HTTP instead of RTSP?**
A: Yes, the code supports http://, https://, and file:// URLs as well.

**Q: How do I test without a real camera?**
A: Use a local video file: `file:///path/to/video.mp4` or stream from another source.

**Q: What if I have multiple cameras?**
A: Create separate config.json files for each camera and run multiple instances.
