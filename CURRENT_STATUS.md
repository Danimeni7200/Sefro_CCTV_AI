## 🔴 Current Issue

**CMake Cache Conflict:**
```
_add_executable cannot create target "local_cpp_client" because another
target with the same name already exists.
```

**Cause:** The build_full directory has a corrupted CMake cache from previous builds.

**Solution:** Use the clean rebuild script to remove the old build and start fresh.

## ✅ Next Steps (DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Open PowerShell
```
Press Win + X → Select "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal"
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Project
```powershell
cd c:\Users\Dani\Desktop\license_plate\packages\local_cpp
```

### Step 3: Run Clean Rebuild
```powershell
.\clean_rebuild.ps1
```

### Step 4: Wait for Build (3-6 minutes)
Look for:
```
Clean Build Complete!
Executable verified: Release\local_cpp_client.exe
```

### Step 5: Run the Client
```powershell
.\Release\local_cpp_client.exe
```

### Step 6: Check for Success
Look for in console output:
```
[StreamReader] Successfully opened stream with backend: FFMPEG
[StreamReader] Stream properties - FPS: 30, Resolution: 1920x1080
Stats - FPS: 15.00, Processed: 15, Dropped: 0
```

---

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After running the client, verify:

- [ ] Console shows "Successfully opened stream"
- [ ] FPS > 0 in stats output
- [ ] No "Failed to open stream" errors
- [ ] Health endpoint works: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8085/status`
- [ ] Logs show frames being processed

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why do I need to clean rebuild?**
A: The CMake cache is corrupted. Cleaning removes the old cache and builds fresh.

**Q: How long will it take?**
A: 3-6 minutes total (mostly compilation time).

**Q: What if the script won't run?**
A: Run this first: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`

**Q: What if it still fails?**
A: Check `CLEAN_REBUILD_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting.

**Q: Will this delete my config?**
A: No, only the build directory is deleted. Your config.json is safe.

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check console output** for specific error messages
2. **Read** `CLEAN_REBUILD_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting
3. **Verify network** with `ping 192.168.4.252`
4. **Test RTSP URL** with VLC
5. **Check logs** in `logs/cpp_client.log`

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when you see:

```
[StreamReader] Successfully opened stream with backend: FFMPEG
[StreamReader] Stream properties - FPS: 30, Resolution: 1920x1080
Stats - FPS: 15.00, Processed: 15, Dropped: 0
```

And FPS is consistently > 0.
