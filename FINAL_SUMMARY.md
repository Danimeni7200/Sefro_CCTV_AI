# Final Summary - RTSP Streaming Issue Diagnosis

## Root Cause Identified

The C++ discovery_only service **IS working correctly**, but the RTSP connection is failing silently because **OpenCV on Windows doesn't properly support RTSP streams without FFMPEG**.

### What's Working ✓
- Discovery service starts on port 8086 ✓
- `/health` endpoint returns 200 OK ✓
- `/discover` endpoint returns candidate URLs ✓  
- `/add_stream` endpoint accepts requests ✓
- Stream capture thread starts ✓

### What's NOT Working ✗
- **RTSP stream capture fails silently** - `cap_.read(frame)` returns false
- **No frames are captured** - `latest_frames_` map stays empty
- **OpenCV can't open RTSP URL** - Connection fails but no error shown

## Why It's Failing

From the test output:
```
ERROR: Failed to open stream!
OpenCV Video I/O backends: DirectShow, Media Foundation
Missing: FFMPEG support for RTSP
```

OpenCV with Media Foundation backend **cannot handle RTSP streams**. You need FFMPEG backend.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Wait for FFMPEG Installation (5-10 minutes)
The vcpkg FFMPEG installation is in progress. Once complete:
1. Rebuild OpenCV with FFMPEG support
2. Rebuild discovery_only.exe
3. Stream should work

### Solution 2: Use Pre-built OpenCV with FFMPEG
Download a pre-built OpenCV with FFMPEG from opencv.org

### Solution 3: Use Direct RTSP URL in Electron (Bypass C++)
- Open the RTSP URL directly in the Electron app
- Use `img src="rtsp://..."` or HTML5 video element
- Simpler but less efficient

## Current Status

- **C++ service**: Running on port 8086 ✓
- **OpenCV**: Installed but lacks FFMPEG support ✗
- **Stream capture**: Failing silently ✗
- **FFMPEG**: Still being installed...

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for FFMPEG to finish installing**
2. **Then rebuild the service with FFMPEG support**
3. **Or use Solution 3 (bypass C++)**

Your Electron app code is correct and ready. The issue is purely the OpenCV RTSP backend.
